Introduction
Blockchair API provides developers with access to data contained in 14 different blockchains. Unlike other APIs, Blockchair also supports numerous analytical queries like filtering, sorting, and aggregating blockchain data.

Here are some examples of what you can build using our API:

A wallet supporting multiple blockchains (request transaction, address, xpub data, and also broadcast transactions)
An analytical service showing some blockchain stats and visualizations
A service tracking the integrity of your or your customers' cold wallets
A solid academic research
Some fun stuff like finding the first Bitcoin block over 1 megabyte in size
For some tasks like extracting lots of blockchain data (e.g. all transactions over a 2 month period) it's better to use our Database dumps feature instead (see https://blockchair.com/dumps for documentation) — it's possible to download the entire database dumps in TSV format and insert the data onto your own database server (like Postgresql or whatever) to further analyze it.

Almost every API endpoint description is accompanied with an example visualization of the data on our website (https://blockchair.com), and it's also worth it to note that the website is working completely using our API (yes, even the data for charts is pulled from one of our endpoints, and it's fully customizable).

Blockchair cares about user privacy, we neither collect nor share with anyone your personal data rather than for statistical purposes. That includes using the API as well. Please refer to our Privacy policy: https://blockchair.com/privacy. Please also check out our Terms of service available here: https://blockchair.com/terms — by using our API, you are agreeing to these terms.

We have a public tracker for bugs, issues, and questions available on GitHub: https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/issues — please use it or contact us by any other means available.

Our API is free to try under some limitations, and we have a variety of premium plans. Please check out the information about the limits and plans.




General stats endpoints
Stats on multiple blockchains at once
Allows to retrieve the most important stats on all blockchains we support via just one API request.

Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/stats
If you require data on just one blockchain, please use https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/stats instead.

Output:

data contains an array with stats on 15 blockchains we support at once:

Bitcoin
Bitcoin Cash
Ethereum
Litecoin
Bitcoin SV
Dogecoin
Dash
Ripple
Groestlcoin
Stellar
Monero
Cardano
Zcash
Mixin
eCash
and on 3 cross-chain tokens:

Tether (USDT)

Dashboard endpoints
Retrieve information about various entities in a neat format from our databases

The API supports a number of calls that produce some aggregated data, or data in a more convenient form for certain entities.

Dashboard endpoints for Bitcoin-like blockchains (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Dash, Groestlcoin, Zcash, eCash, Bitcoin Testnet)
Block info
Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/block/{:height}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/block/{:hash}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/blocks/{:height}₀,...,{:height}ᵩ (up to 10 blocks, comma-separated)
https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/blocks/{:hash}₀,...,{:hash}ᵩ (up to 10 blocks, comma-separated)
Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:height}ᵢ is the block height (integer value), also known as block id
{:hash}ᵢ is the block hash (regex: /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i)
Possible options:

?limit={:limit} limits the number of returned transaction hashes contained in the block. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000. In case of 0 returns an empty transaction hashes array
?offset={:offset} allows to paginate transaction hashes. Default is 0. Maximum is 1000000.
Output:

data contains an associative array where found block heights or block hashes used as keys:

data.{:id}ᵢ.block - information about the block (see Bitcoin-like block object for the field descriptions)
data.{:id}ᵢ.transactions - the array of transaction hashes (sorted by position in the block ascending) included in the block (respecting the set limit and offset)
Where {:id}ᵢ is either {:height}ᵢ or {:hash}ᵢ from the query string. If there's no {:id}ᵢ has been found in the database, there won't be such key.

Note that the total number of transactions in the block is contained in data.{:id}ᵢ.block.transaction_count

Context keys:

context.results — number of found blocks
context.limit — applied limit
context.offset — applied offset
context.state — best block height on the {:btc_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = context.state - data.{:id}ᵢ.block.id + 1)

Transaction info
Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/transaction/{:hash}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/dashboards/transactions/{:hash}₀,...,{:hash}ᵩ (up to 10 transactions, comma-separated)
Where:

{:chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:hashᵢ} is the transaction hash (regex: /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i), also known as txid
Possible options:

?omni=true (for bitcoin only; in alpha test mode) — shows information about Omni Layer token transfers in this transaction
Output:

data contains an associative array where found transaction hashes are used as keys:

data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction — information about the transaction (see Bitcoin-like transaction object)
data.{:hash}ᵢ.inputs — the array of transaction inputs (sorted by spending_index ascending), where each element is a Bitcoin-like output object (inputs represented as spent outputs), or an empty array in case of coinbase transaction
data.{:hash}ᵢ.outputs — the array of transaction outputs (sorted by index ascending), where each element is a Bitcoin-like output object
Additional data:

data.{:hash}ᵢ.layer_2.omni (for bitcoin only; in alpha test mode) — Omni layer transaction data in case there's any
scripthash_type field for inputs and outputs (example: https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/dashboards/transaction/4d41241148a7cb8f4e2820d4393415ccd3d0793053a3855b44c33e5053c231ff) in the multisig_{:m}_of_{:n} format. Please note that if output is unspent, scripthash_type will always be null, even if the associated address multisig type can be derived from some other spent output.
data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction.is_rbf (for bitcoin and bitcoin/testnet only) — yields true if the transaction can be replaced with a transaction with a higher fee (replace-by-fee), and false otherwise; for blockchain transactions it shows whether the transaction could've been replaced before it has been included into the block.
In case transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction.block_id contains the block number it's included in. If the transaction is in the mempool, data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction.block_id yields -1. If the transaction is neither present in the blockchain, nor in the mempool, there won't be data.{:hash}ᵢ key with data.

Context keys:

context.results — number of found transactions
context.state — best block height on the {:chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation transaction received using this formula: confirmations = data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id - context.state + 1, or if data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id is -1 it's an unconfirmed transaction)

Bonus endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/transaction/{:hash}₀/priority
For mempool transactions shows priority (position) — for chains supporting SegWit by fee_per_kwu, for others by fee_per_kb— over other transactions (out_of mempool transactions). position is null if the transaction is neither in the mempool nor in the blockchain, confirmed if it's in the blockchain. eta_seconds returns an approximate time for the transaction to confirm (in seconds, exprimental). Cost: 1.

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/dashboards/xpub/{:extended_key} (info on xpub, ypub, or zpub extended key; further referred to as the xpub dashboard)
Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:address}ᵢ is the address, possible formats are:

p2pk/p2pkh format (supported for all blockchains, example for Bitcoin: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa)
p2sh format (supported for all blockchains, example for Bitcoin: 342ftSRCvFHfCeFFBuz4xwbeqnDw6BGUey)
Only for the dashboards/address endpoint Bitcoin Cash also supports Legacy address variant, and Bitcoin SV supports CashAddr variant for p2pkh and p2sh formats. It's also possible to use bitcoincash: prefix (examples: qzyl04w3m99ddpqahzwghn3erallm3e7z5le4aqqmh or bitcoincash:qzyl04w3m99ddpqahzwghn3erallm3e7z5le4aqqmh for both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV.
bech32 format (witness_v0_keyhash, witness_v0_scripthash, or witness_unknown — supported for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Groestlcoin, and Bitcoin Testnet only; example for Bitcoin: bc1q34aq5drpuwy3wgl9lhup9892qp6svr8ldzyy7c)
Internal Blockchair format (for multisig. nulldata, and nonstandard output types)
For eCash the ecash: prefix and format are used
{:extended_key} is the extended public key, possible formats are:

xpub (supported for all blockchains, example for Bitcoin: xpub6CUGRUonZSQ4TWtTMmzXdrXDtypWKiKrhko4egpiMZbpiaQL2jkwSB1icqYh2cfDfVxdx4df189oLKnC5fSwqPfgyP3hooxujYzAu3fDVmz, yields p2pkh addresses)
ypub (supported for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Groestlcoin, and Bitcoin Testnet only, example for Bitcoin: ypub6XiW9nhToS1gjVsFKzgmtWZuqo6V1YY7xaCns37aR3oYhFyAsTehAqV1iW2UCNtgWFQFkz3aNSZZbkfe5d1tD8MzjZuFJQn2XnczsxtjoXr, yields p2sh addresses)

Note that custom xpub formats (e.g. ltub for Litecoin) are not supported.

Possible options:

?limit={:transaction_limit},{:utxo_limit} or a shorthand ?limit={:limit}. {:transaction_limit} limits the number of returned latest transaction hashes (in the transactions array) for an address or an address set. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000. In case of 0 returns an empty transaction hashes array. {:utxo_limit} limits the number of returned latest UTXOs (in the utxo array) for an address or an address set. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000. In case of 0 returns an empty UTXO array. If only one limit is set, it applies to both {:transaction_limit} and {:utxo_limit} (e.g. ?limit=100 is an equivalent of ?limit=100,100).
?offset={:transaction_offset},{:utxo_offest} or a shorthand ?offset={:offset} allows to paginate transaction hashes and the UTXO array. The behaviour is similar to the ?limit= section. Default for both offset is 0, and the maximum is 1000000.
?transaction_details=true — returns detailed info on transactions instead of just hashes in the transactions array. Each element contains block_id, transaction_hash, time, and balance_change (shows how the transactions affected the balance of {:address}, i.e. it can be a negative value). This option is available for all three endpoints: dashboards/address, dashboards/addresses, and dashboards/xpub.
?omni=true (for bitcoin only; in alpha test mode) — shows information about Omni Layer tokens belonging to the address. At the moment, this option is available for the address endpoint only. The data is returned in the layer_2.omni array.
?state=latest — discards unconfirmed transactions from the output — balance will show only confirmed balance, and transactions and utxo arrays won't include unconfirmed data.
Output:

Please note that while the only difference between for example transaction and transactions dashboards is the number of elements in the data array, address and addresses differ semantically. address returns info on a single address with its recent transaction hashes and its UTXO set, while addresses and xpub return info on an address set (as well as some stats on separate addresses) where transaction hashes and the UTXO set are returned for the entire set (that's more useful for wallets as in most cases the task is, for example, to retrieve latest 10 transaction hashes for a set of addresses sorted by time descending, but not 10 transactions for each address as it's not clear how to sort them).

Here's how these three dashboard calls structured (see more detailed examples below):

address endpoint (single address):

data
{:address}₀
address — an associative array with address info (balance, script_hex, transaction_count, etc.)
transactions — an array of latest transaction hashes where the address is a participant (either sender or recipient)
utxo — the UTXO set for the address
context — some context info
addresses endpoint (2 addresses for example):

data
set — an associative array with info on the address set (balance yields the total balance of 2 addresses, transaction_count is for both, etc.)
addresses
{:address}₀ — an associative array with the first address info (balance, script_hex, output_count, etc.)
{:address}₁ — an associative array with the second address info (balance, script_hex, output_count, etc.)
transactions — an array of latest transaction hashes for the entire set
utxo — the UTXO set for the address set
context — some context info
xpub endpoint:

data
{:extended_key}
xpub — an associative array with xpub info (balance yields the total balance of all addresses derived from the xpub, transaction_count, etc.)
addresses
{:address}₀ — an associative array with the first address info (balance, script_hex, output_count, etc.)
{:address}₁ — an associative array with the second address info (balance, script_hex, output_count, etc.)
transactions — an array of latest transaction hashes for the entire set
utxo — the UTXO set for the address set
context — some context info
Note that currently the maximum depth for xpub address discovery is 250 main addresses and 250 change addresses (larger limits up to 10.000 main / 10.000 change are available on Premium plans). According to BIP 32, our engine looks for 20 addresses at once, and if there's no transactions associated with this set, it stops looking.

data.addresses for both the addresses and the xpub endpoints don't include addresses which don't participate in transactions.

Address object specification:

type — address type (the same as type here, can be one of these: pubkey (P2PK), pubkeyhash (P2PKH), scripthash (P2SH), multisig, nulldata (OP_RETURN), nonstandard, witness_v0_keyhash (P2WPKH), witness_v0_scripthash (P2WSH), witness_unknown)
script_hex — output script (in hex) corresponding to the address
balance — address balance in satoshi (hereinafter — including unconfirmed outputs unless ?state=latest option is used)
balance_usd — address balance in USD
received — total received in satoshi
received_usd — total received in USD
spent — total spent in satoshi
spent_usd — total spent in USD
output_count — the number of outputs this address received
unspent_output_count — number of unspent outputs for this address (i.e. the number of inputs for an address can be calculated as output_count-unspent_output_count)
first_seen_receiving — timestamp (UTC) when the first time this address received coins
last_seen_receiving — timestamp (UTC) when the last time this address received coins
first_seen_spending — timestamp (UTC) when the first time this address sent coins
last_seen_spending — timestamp (UTC) when the last time this address sent coins
transaction_count — number of unique transactions this address participating in (available only in the address endpoint)
path — derived address path (available only in the xpub endpoint)
scripthash_type — in case the type is either scripthash (P2SH) or witness_v0_scripthash (P2WSH) — yields multisig type in the following format: multisig_{:m}_of_{:n}. If it's not multisig, or it's not possible to derive the type because there has been no spendings from this address — yields null. Available only in the address endpoint.
Context keys:

context.results — number of found addresses
context.limit — applied limit
context.offset — applied offset
context.state — best block height on the {:btc_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = context.state - data.{:id}ᵢ.block.id + 1)
context.checked (for the xpub endpoint only) — lists the addresses checked by our engine with their paths

Request cost formula:

1 for the address endpoint (add 1 if ?omni=true is used)
1 + (0.1 * (entity count - 1)) for the addresses endpoint (e.g. it's 1 + (0.1 * (100 - 1)) = 10.9 for requesting 100 addresses)
1 + 2 * depth - 0.1 for the xpub endpoint, where depth is the number of 20-addresses iterations (BIP 32 standard). The minimum number of iterations is 1 (the cost would be 2.9 in that case), if there are 5 iterations required, 100 addresses will be checked in total (the cost would be 10.9)
Additional 1 point if ?transaction_details=true is used

Address balance mass check
This endpoint returns confirmed balances only. If address hasn't been seen on the blockchain or has a zero balance, it's not shown among the results. It's extremely fast (under 1 second for 25.000 addresses) and cheap (it costs only 26 request points to fetch 25.000 addresses).

Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/addresses/balances (POST)
https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/addresses/balances?addresses={:comma_separated_list} (GET)
Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:comma_separated_list} is the comma-separated list of addresses (up to 25.000)
Example output:

https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/addresses/balances?addresses=34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo,35hK24tcLEWcgNA4JxpvbkNkoAcDGqQPsP,1DoesntExist:

}
Example POST request:

> curl -v --data "addresses=34xp4vRoCGJym3xR7yCVPFHoCNxv4Twseo,35hK24tcLEWcgNA4JxpvbkNkoAcDGqQPsP,1DoesntExist" https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/addresses/balances
(it's better to use POST for long requests)

Request cost formula:

1 + 0.001 per each requested address (i.e. for 25.000 addresses it's just 25, so it's the best and the fastest way to fetch balances)

Dashboard endpoints for Ethereum
Block info
Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/block/{:height}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/block/{:hash}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/blocks/{:height}₀,...,{:height}ᵩ (up to 10 blocks, comma-separated)
https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/blocks/{:hash}₀,...,{:hash}ᵩ (up to 10 blocks, comma-separated)
Where:

{:eth_chain} can only be: ethereum or ethereum/testnet
{:height}ᵢ is the block height (integer value), also known as block id
{:hash}ᵢ is the block hash (regex: /^0x[0-9a-f]{64}$/i)
Possible options:

?limit={:limit} limits the number of returned transaction hashes contained in the block. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000. In case of 0 returns an empty transaction hashes array
?offset={:offset} allows to paginate transaction hashes. Default is 0. Maximum is 1000000.
Output:

data contains an associative array where found block heights or block hashes used as keys:

data.{:id}ᵢ.block — information about the block (see Ethereum-like block object for the field descriptions)
data.{:id}ᵢ.transactions — the array of transaction hashes (sorted by position in the block ascending) included in the block (respecting the set limit and offset)
data.{:id}ᵢ.synthetic_transactions — array of internal Blockchair ids of synthetic transactions. By synthetic transactions we understand state changes in the blockchain which don't have parental transaction entities, i.e. transferring miner reward (for blocks and uncles), coin generation in the genesis block, etc. This array is not iterable, and always yields the entire result set.
data.{:id}ᵢ.uncles — the array of hashes of the block's uncles (in case there are no uncles — an empty array). This array is not iterable as well, and always yields the entire result set.
Where {:id}ᵢ is either {:height}ᵢ or {:hash}ᵢ from the query string.

If there's no {:id}ᵢ has been found in the database, there won't be such key.

Note that the total number of transactions in the block is contained in data.{:id}ᵢ.block.transaction_count, but that doesn't take synthetic transactions into account (use data.{:id}ᵢ.block.synthetic_transaction_count instead)

Context keys:

context.results — number of found blocks
context.limit — applied limit
context.offset — applied offset
context.state — best block height on the {:eth_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = context.state - data.{:id}ᵢ.block.id + 1)

context.state: best block height on the {:eth_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation transaction received using this formula: confirmations = data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id - context.state + 1, or if data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id is -1 it's an unconfirmed transaction)

https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/transactions/{:hash}₀,...,{:hash}ᵩ (up to 10 transactions, comma-separated)
Where:

{:eth_chain} can only be: ethereum or ethereum/testnet
{:hashᵢ} is the transaction hash (regex: /^0x[0-9a-f]{64}$/i), also known as txid
Possible options:

?erc_20=true shows information about ERC-20 token transfers in this transaction
?effects=true shows state changes for the transaction
?trace_mempool=true — this option tries to retrieve a list of internall calls for mempool transactions. In conjunction with &erc_20=true it also shows the list of ERC-20 transfers. This is an experimental feature. Please note that internal transfers may get invalidated when transaction gets confirmed.
?assets_in_usd=true — adds value_usd_now to all layer_2.erc_20 items yielding the current (not at the moment of the transaction!) USD value of tokens (null if the price is unknown)
?events=true — this option costs 1 additional request point to use. When enabled, it adds an array of event logs to the output. Every log contains topics, data, contract, log_index, and decoded_event. Depending on how much our API knows about the event signature, there are 3 detalization levels for decoded_event (example transaction with all 3: https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/dashboards/transaction/0x7d52cf58fe78403e8816dae6e900baff92b35760b4ed81cecd2590eafcde3dad?events=true):
Full data: decoded_event contains both the full event name with its argument names (name_full, example: Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)), and the argument values in the arguments array;
Partial data: only name_with_types is known (example: Withdrawal(address, uint256)), arguments yields null;
No data: decoded_event yields null.
Output:

data contains an associative array where found transaction hashes are used as keys:

data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction — information about the transaction (see Ethereum-like transaction object)
data.{:hash}ᵢ.calls — the array of all calls made during the execution of the transaction (always null for mempool transactions and the last 6 blocks)
Additional data:

data.{:hash}ᵢ.layer_2.erc_20 (only if ?erc_20=true is set) — an array of ERC-20 transfers (or an empty array if there are none), Each array element contains the following keys: token_address, token_name, token_symbol, token_decimals, sender, recipient, value — field descriptions are available here.
data.{:hash}ᵢ.effects (only if ?effects=true is set) — yields all ETH ad ERC-20 balance changes for the transaction in a neat format. Keys are 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for ETH or token address for ERC-20's. Each array element contains the following keys: asset_type, asset_name, asset_symbol, asset_decimals, changes. changes is an array containing all the changes for the asset (keys are Ethereum addresses, and values are balance changes). Please note this option is experimental. Example request: https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/dashboards/transaction/0xd9a24f57c713207c39c58e8ef3cb44e115fcc8bd0f85eb4ea82c78bc065a723f?effects=true&erc_20=true. If ?erc_20=true option is not used, ?effects=true won't yield ERC-20 data.
In case transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction.block_id contains the block number it's included in. If the transaction is in the mempool, data.{:hash}ᵢ.transaction.block_id yields -1. If the transaction is neither present in the blockchain, nor in the mempool, there won't be data.{:hash}ᵢ key with data.

Context keys:

context.results — number of found transactions
context.state — best block height on the {:eth_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation transaction received using this formula: confirmations = data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id - context.state + 1, or if data.{:id}ᵢ.transaction.block_id is -1 it's an unconfirmed transaction)
context.state_layer_2 — the latest block number for which our engine has processed second layer (e.g. ERC-20) transactions. If it's less than the block id in your current environment (e.g. block id of a transaction you requested), it makes sense to repeat the request after some time to retrieve second layer data

Bonus endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/transaction/{:hash}₀/priority
For mempool transactions shows priority (position) by gas_price over other transactions (out_of mempool transactions). position is null if the transaction is not in the mempool. eta_seconds returns an approximate time for the transaction to confirm (in seconds, exprimental). Cost: 1.

Request cost formula:

1 for https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/transaction/{:hash}₀ endpoint
1 + (0.1 * (entity count - 1)) for https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/transactions/{:hash}₀,...,{:hash}ᵩ endpoint (e.g. it's 1 + (0.1 * (10 - 1)) = 1.9 for requesting 10 transactions)
Using ?erc_20=true adds 1 for each requested transaction
Using ?effects=true adds 1 for each requested transaction
Using ?events=true adds 1 for each requested transaction
Using ?trace_mempool=true adds 1 for each requested transaction

Address info
Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:eth_chain}/dashboards/address/{:address}₀
Where:

{:eth_chain} can only be: ethereum or ethereum/testnet
{:address}ᵢ is an Ethereum address (either an account or a contract, the address should start with 0x)
Possible options:

?limit={:call_limit} — limits the number of returned latest calls associated with the address. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000.
?offset={:call_offset} — allows to paginate calls. Default is 0, and the maximum is 1000000.
?erc_20={...} — returns information about ERC-20 token balances of the address (tokens are sorted by market capitalization descending):
?erc_20=approximate (or ?erc_20=true, default) — yields all token balances from our database. These values may miss some non-standard transfers in tokens that don't follow the ERC-20 standard in full. Please double-check if this option returns correct values for the tokens you'd want to get information about. Using this option costs 1.
?erc_20=precise — yields all token balances from our node. The process is the following: we gather information from our database about potential ERC-20 tokens the address may hold, and then for each token we call getBalance function using our node to get precise balances. Please note that if for some reason some contract doesn't follow the ERC-20 standard, our database may still miss records about the address holding this token, and there will be no request to the node about this token. So while balances yielded with this option are precise, some non-standard tokens may still be missed. Using this option costs 2.
?erc_20={:token_address}₀,...,{:token_address}ᵩ (recommended) — yields balances for the enlisted ERC-20 tokens from our node. That's the recommended way if you have an exact list of tokens you'd like to check. Even if some token doesn't follow the ERC-20 standard, but still has getBalance function implemented, the correct balance will be returned. Using this option costs 0.75 + 0.01 for each contract checked (the cheapest option!)
?nonce=true — returns current account nonce (mempool transactions are taken in account)
?output=type — this option scrubs all the output data except for the address type (account or contract). This may be a very fast handy way to retrieve address type instead of requesting full address data
?assets_in_usd=true — adds asset_balance_usd to the output yielding the total USD value of all (excluding ETH) account assets (currently it's most popular ERC-20 tokens only), as well as balance_usd to all layer_2.erc_20 items. If the exchange rate for a particular token is unknown, returns null for this token.
?state=latest — if this option is enabled, balance will yield the confirmed balance, and the calls array won't include unconfirmed data
?contract_details=true — if applied, it adds additional data on the address if it's a contract. At the moment, it works with ERC-20 contracts only yielding token_name, token_symbol, and token_decimals. It also yields some additional fields for all contracts: creating_transaction_hash, creating_address, and creating_transaction_time. The additional cost of using this option is 0.5
Output:

In case the address has been found, data.{:address}₀ returns an array consisting of the following elements:

address
address.type — address type (account — for a simple address, contract — for a contract)
address.contract_code_hex — hex code of the contract at the moment of creation (for a contract), or null for an address
address.contract_created — for contracts only — if the contact was indeed created then true, if not (i.e. with a failed create call) — false, for a simple address yields null
address.contract_destroyed — for contracts only — if the contact was successfully destroyed (SELFDESCTRUCT) then true, if not — false; for a simple address yields null
address.balance — exact address balance in wei (here and below values in wei returned as strings as they don't fit into integers)
address.balance_usd — address balance in USD (float)
address.received_approximate — total received in wei (approximately) †
address.received_usd — total received in USD (approximately) †
address.spent_approximate — total spent in wei (approximately) †
address.spent_usd — total spent in USD (approximately) †
address.fees_approximate — total spent in transaction fees in wei (approximately) †
address.fees_usd — total spent in transaction fees in USD (approximately) †
address.receiving_call_count — number of calls the address has received, where value transfer occured ‡
address.spending_call_count — number of calls that has been made by this address where value transfer occured ‡
address.call_count — total number of calls the address participated in (may be greater than receiving_call_count + spending_call_count, because it also takes failed calls into account)
address.transaction_count — number of transactions the address participated in
address.first_seen_receiving — timestamp (UTC) when the address received a successful incoming call for the first time
address.last_seen_receiving — timestamp (UTC) when the address received a successful incoming call for the last time
address.first_seen_spending — timestamp (UTC) when the address sent a successful call for the first time
address.last_seen_spending — timestamp (UTC) when the address sent a successful call for the last time
address.nonce — current account nonce (only if ?nonce=true is set, null otherwise)
calls — an array of the latest address call, each element of an array containing the following elements: block_id, transaction_hash, index, time, sender, recipient, value, value_usd, transferred (see the description here)
layer_2.erc_20 (only if ?erc_20=true is set) — the array of ERC-20 token balances of the address, each element contains the following fields: token_address, token_name, token_symbol, token_decimals, balance_approximate (number of tokens), balance (exact number of tokens in the smallest denomination). Note that balance ≈ balance_approximate * 10 ^ token_decimals.
Additional data:

data.{:hash}ᵢ.layer_2.erc_20 (or an empty array if there are none), Each array element contains the following keys: token_address, token_name, token_symbol, token_decimals, sender, recipient, value — field descriptions are available here.
context.results contains the number of found addresses (0 or 1).

Notes:

† — for these fields the wei value can be rounded. For a million of calls, the rounding error can be more than 1 ether.
‡ — only those calls are counted that fit the following condition: transferred = true, i.e. calls that do not change state (including staticcall, failed calls, etc.) are not taken into account
Context keys:

context.results — number of found addresses
context.limit — applied limit
context.offset — applied offset
context.state — best block height on the {:eth_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = block_id - context.state + 1)
context.state_layer_2 — the latest block number for which our engine has processed second layer (e.g. ERC-20) transactions. If it's less than the block id in your current environment (e.g. block id of a transaction you requested), it makes sense to repeat the request after some time to retrieve second layer data

Where:

{:token_address} is the token contract address (should start with 0x)
{:address} is an Ethereum address (either an account or a contract, the address should start with 0x)
Possible options:

?limit={:transaction_limit} — limits the number of returned latest transactions associated with the address. Default is 100. Maximum is 10000.
?offset={:transaction_offset} — allows to paginate transactions. Default is 0, and the maximum is 1000000.
Output:

The structure is similar to the Ethereum address endpoint with the following differences:

It shows balances in tokens instead of ethers
Fields like first_seen_receiving mean "first seen receiving tokens" instead of "ethers"
Instead of the calls array, there's the transactions array with the latest token transactions (see this for field descriptions). It's iterable using the ?offset= section.
Context keys:

context.results — number of found addresses
context.limit — applied limit
context.offset — applied offset
context.state — best block height on the {:eth_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = block_id - context.state + 1)
context.state_layer_2 — the latest block number for which our engine has processed second layer (e.g. ERC-20) transactions.

Cross-chain checks
Multichain address check
This endpoint allows to check multiple addresses from diffrerent blockchain via just one request. This can be useful if you're monitoring your own wallet or portfolio.

Endpoint:

`https://api.blockchair.com/multi/dashboards/addresses/{:address}₀,...,{:address}ᵩ
Where:

{:address}₀,...,{:address}ᵩ is a comma separated list of addresses in the blockchain:address format. Supported blockchains: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dash, groestlcoin, zcash. More blockchains are coming in the future. bitcoin-cash and bitcoin-sv may be used as bitcoincash and bitcoinsv respectively. Only CashAddr format is supported for Bictoin Cash. The maximum number of addresses is 100. There can only be one Ethereum address in the list.
Output:

data.set — information on the entire set (total USD balance, etc.)
data.addresses — an array of info on addresses found
data.transactions — list of the latest transactions for this set (similar to ?transaction_details=true option for {:btc_chain}/dashboards/address endpoint)
Example output:

Request cost formula:

The total cost is the same as if you'd use dashboards/addresses endpoints for the requested blockchains separately with the ?transaction_details=true option enabled. In the example, the cost is 5.1, and it's calculated as the sum of using the following endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/dashboards/addresses/1JADsmDFX9d2TXis63S9F9L8eDAXwJmnWE,1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa?transaction_details=true (cost: 2.1)
https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/dashboards/address/0x19DdD94B94D3c68385c897846AB44Ac99DBFAe0f (cost: 1)
https://api.blockchair.com/litecoin/dashboards/addresses/LNAifc8nfjtDJ8azRPiancbZSBftPzhfzb?transaction_details=true (cost: 2)




Raw data endpoints for Bitcoin-like blockchains (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Dash, Groestlcoin, Zcash, eCash, Bitcoin Testnet)
Raw block data
Returns raw block data directly from our full node. If the block is larger than 10 megabytes in size, returns a 402 error.

Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/raw/block/{:height}₀
https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/raw/block/{:hash}₀
Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:height}ᵢ is the block height (integer value), also known as block id
{:hash}ᵢ is the block hash (regex: /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i)
Output:

data contains an associative array:

data.{:id}ᵢ.raw_block — raw block represented as a hex string
data.{:id}ᵢ.decoded_raw_block — raw block encoded in JSON by our node. Please note that the structure of this JSON array may change as we upgrade our nodes, and this won't be reflected in our change logs. We don't provide field descriptions for raw endpoints, that information can be found on the Bitcoin Core website (all Bitcoin-like blockchains the same output structure).
Where {:id}ᵢ is either {:height}ᵢ or {:hash}ᵢ from the query string. If there's no {:id}ᵢ has been found on the blockchain, returns an empty array.

Context keys:

context.state: best block height on the {:btc_chain} chain (tip: it's possible to calculate the number of confirmation block received using this formula: confirmations = context.state - data.{:id}ᵢ.block.id + 1)

is_from_coinbase	boolean	Is it a coinbase transaction output?	=		+	
is_spendable	null or boolean	Is it theoretically possible to spend this output? For pubkey and multisig outputs, the existence of the corresponding private key is tested, in that case true and false are the possible values depending on the result of the check. For nulldata outputs it is always false. For other types it is impossible to check trivially, in that case null is yielded.	=		+	
isspent | boolean | Has this output been spent? **(`spending* fields below yield null if it is not)** | = | | +`	
spending_block_id	null or int	Id of the block containing the spending transaction	*	+	+	
spending_transaction_id	null or int	Internal Blockchair transaction id where the output was spent	*	+		
spending_index	null or int	Input index in the spending transaction (from 0)	*	+

cdd	null or float	The number of coindays destroyed spending the output, null if the output hasn't been spent	*	+		+
Additional synthetic columns

Column	Type	Description	Q?	S?	A?	C?
script_bin	string .*	Text (UTF-8) representation of script_hex. Allows you to use the LIKE operator: ?q=script_bin(~hello). Filtering using the LIKE operator is performed for nulldata outputs only.	~			
Notes:

increased efficiency method applies if querying transaction_id and spending_transaction_id columns using the equals operator
† — only for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Groestlcoin, and Bitcoin Testnet (SegWit data)
The default sorting — transaction_id DESC
spending_* columns yield null for outputs that haven't been spent yet
block_id for mempool transactions is -1
spending_block_id is -1 for outputs being spent by an unconfirmed transaction
This particular table is in beta test mode on our platform. It's possible to receive duplicate rows for outputs which have just been spent. Sometimes duplicates are removed automatically, but in that case the number of rows may be less than the set limit on the number of rows. There's an additional context key context.pre_rows which contains the number of rows that should've been returned before the duplicate removal process.

addresses view
Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/addresses?{:query}
Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, ecash, bitcoin/testnet
{:query} is the query against the table (how to build a query)
Output:

The addresses view contains the list of all addresses and their confirmed balances. Unlike other infinitables (blocks, transactions, outputs) this table isn't live, it's automatically updated every 5 minutes with new data, thus we classify it as a "view". data contains an array of database rows. Each row is in the following format:

Column	Type	Description	Q?	S?	A?	C?
address	string [0-9a-zA-Z\-]*	Bitcoin address or synthetic address				
balance	int	Its confirmed balance	*	+		+
Notes:

the default sorting — balance DESC

Misc endpoints
Broadcasting transactions
Broadcast a transaction to the network

Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/push/transaction (POST request)
Where:

{:chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, bitcoin/testnet, mixin
POST data should contain data parameter with raw transaction represented in hex (for Ethereum it should start with 0x)
Output:

If the transaction has been successfully broadcast to the network, API will return a JSON response (code 200) containing data array with transaction_hash key holding the hash of the received transaction. In case of any error (wrong transaction format, spending already spent outputs, etc.) API returns status code 400 and an error desription if available (descriptions aren't shown for ethereum and mixin).

Example of a successful response:

{
  "data": {
    "transaction_hash": "0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098"
  },
  "context": {
  	"code": 200,
  	...
  }
}
Example of a response to an invalid transaction:

{
  "data": null,
  "context": {
    "code": 400,
    "error": "Invalid transaction. Error: 16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Signature must use SIGHASH_FORKID)"
    ...
  }
}
Example request:

> curl -v --data "data=01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000" https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/push/transaction
Tip: for testing purpose it's possible to use GET request instead of POST like this: https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/push/transaction?data=0100000001000000000000000000000000...

Nodes
List of full network nodes

Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/nodes (agregated data on nodes + node list)
https://api.blockchair.com/nodes (agregated data on nodes for 8 networks at once)
Please note that the number of nodes is also available in the https://api.blockchair.com/stats and https://api.blockchair.com/{:btc_chain}/stats endpoints output.

Where:

{:btc_chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash
Output:

data contains an array of arrays:

data.nodes — the node list; the key is {:ip}:{:port}, each element contains version (node version), country (2 letter country code derived from the IP address based on geolocation), height (node reports this number as the best block number it has, flags (special field with node options)
data.count — total number of nodes
data.countries — number of nodes grouped by country codes
data.versions — number of nodes grouped by node version
data.heights — number of nodes grouped by their best block height
https://api.blockchair.com/nodes endpoint shows this data for 8 coins at once (bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash), but it doesn't have the data.nodes array, i.e. there's only aggregated data.

Example output:

State changes
Allows to query state changes caused by a block and potential state changes caused by mempool transactions in case they get confirmed.

Endpoints:

https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/block/{:height} (state changes caused by a block)
https://api.blockchair.com/{:chain}/state/changes/mempool (potential state changes caused by mempool transactions)
Where:

{:chain} can be one of these: bitcoin, bitcoin-cash, litecoin, bitcoin-sv, dogecoin, dash, groestlcoin, zcash, bitcoin/testnet. The first endpoint also supports ethereum
{:height} is the block height (integer value), also known as block id
Output:

The response contains an array where the keys are addresses which were affected by the block (or the mempool), and the values are balance changes.

Note: values are returned as strings for Ethereum.

No iteration required, this endpoint outputs all state changes at once.

Example requests:

https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/170
https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/mempool
https://api.blockchair.com/ethereum/state/changes/block/46147
Example output:

https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/170:

{
  "data": {
    "1PSSGeFHDnKNxiEyFrD1wcEaHr9hrQDDWc": 5000000000,
    "1Q2TWHE3GMdB6BZKafqwxXtWAWgFt5Jvm3": 1000000000,

  },
  "context": {
    ...
    "results": 3,
    ...
  }
}
The block in this example was the first Bitcoin block which contained a non-coinbase transaction. We can see the coinbase reward here (50 BTC) sent to the miner, and two state changes caused by a 10 BTC transaction.

Example usage:

This endpoint may be useful if you need to track balance changes for a lot of addresses — you can simply track state changes and find the needed addresses there instead of constantly retrieving information about the balances. Here's an example logic for an application watching for Bitcoin transactions incoming/outgoing to/from 1 million addresses:

latest_known_block_height = 0
addresses = [1Abc, 1Efg, 1Hij, ...]
while (true)
    api_response = api_request('https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/mempool')
    if any of api_response.data keys are in the addresses array
        print 'Found new transaction in the mempool'
    if latest_known_block_height < api_response.context.state // A new block has been mined (context.state always yields the latest block number)
        latest_known_block_height = api_response.context.state
        api_response_block = api_request('https://api.blockchair.com/bitcoin/state/changes/block/{:api_response.context.state}')
        if any of api_response_block.data keys are in the addresses array
            print 'Found new transaction in the latest block'
    sleep(10) // The mempool data is cached for 10 seconds on our servers by default
Note that this example doesn't account for cases like new multiple blocks have been found while you were requesting the latest one, etc. See this example as a possible workaround: https://github.com/Blockchair/Blockchair.Support/pull/207/files

Request cost formula:

5 for changes caused by a block, 10 for changes caused by mempool transactions.

Available block ranges
As Blockchair doesn't store historical data for some blockchains (at this moment this applies to Ripple and Stellar only) it may be useful to know which blocks can be queried.

Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/range
Output:

The response contains an array where the keys are blockchains, and the values are arrays containing:

blockchain_first_entry — first block (or ledger) id on the blockchain
blockchain_first_entry_date — its date
blockchair_first_entry — first block id Blockchair processes
blockchair_first_entry_date — its date
is_full — whether we have the full history for this blockchain

Release monitor
This endpoint returns the list of latest software (core clients) releases for blockchains we support. This may be useful for those who want to track blockchain development, new features, and hard forks (especially this is useful for multi-currency blockchain software — wallets or exchanges — developers). Never miss a BSV hard fork anymore!

Endpoint:

https://api.blockchair.com/tools/releases
Possible options:

?chain={:chain} displays latest releases for {:chain} only
Output:

data contains an array of latest releases sorted by time for all chains we support (or for a specific chain if ?chain is set). Each element is an array with the following elements:

chain — chain id
version — tag name
time — release publish time (UTC)
link — link to this release on GitHub
context has two special fields:

latest_update — latest update time (UTC)
supported_chains — array of chains monitored with their chain ids and software names

Privacy-o-meter
Introduction
While Bitcoin is considered to be a privacy-oriented system, the blockchain is open to analyze by anyone, and there are numerous transaction tracing tools like Chainalysis, Coinfirm, Elliptic, CipherTrace, and Crystal. They're all not free, and Bitcoin users rarely have a chance to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. We start with a simple transaction scoring tool, and will soon expand this even further. We'll provide this service for free as we hope it'd help Bitcoin users to take some of their privacy back.

Transaction tracing is quite an easy task on the Bitcoin blockchain due to the following reasons:

Most users aren't concerned enough about their privacy and make rookie mistakes like sending round BTC amounts
Wallet software developers mostly don't care about user privacy. Taking the previous example in context, there are no warnings if user tries to send a round amount.
There are multiple wallets with different transaction processing rules making it possible to figure out what software type given user uses
Bitcoin blockchain is congested due to refusal to properly scale — that makes using mixers very expensive and cumbersome
While there are multiple protocols allowing more secure ways to transact (like shielded transactions on Zcash), these are not implemented in Bitcoin out of fears of changing the protocol
Bitcoin has multiple standard script types, their number has been recently increased with the activation of SegWit, and will increase further with new constructs built on top of SegWit
Here's a good overview of some basic heuristics: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy — we use most of them and introduce many new ones. The full list of heuristics we're using is available below.

At the moment, Privacy-o-meter is available for Bitcoin only, but we'll soon expand it to other UTXO-based coins, and then to all the others we support.

A couple of examples of transactions with bad and good privacy scores

Take this transaction as an example: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/116bd19a3ec5f210ce72043115a4d5d3ef08f7556829c4feac8d89de3195ea4e

It has 2 inputs and 2 outputs:

Input addresses	Input values		Output values	Output addresses
bc1qj9p0huddhg5pzccur…	0.96350000 BTC	⟾	1.00000000 BTC	3EgAFC6FKojYUu53…
bc1qrpfxyvdc3fqmyux54…	281.65022105 BTC	⟾	281.61332105 BTC	bc1qva7utdxd6easlj…
And also the following characteristics:

Uses SegWit: yes
Lock time: 0
Version: 1
An analyst will be able to gather lots of metadata looking at this transaction:

First output has a round amount of 1 bitcoin
First output has a P2SH address type while both inputs and the second output are P2WSH
Given (1) and (2) it can be assumed that 3EgAFC6FKojYUu53… is the recipient, and bc1qva7utdxd6easlj… is the change address. Thus we can say that bc1qj9p0huddhg5pzccur…, bc1qrpfxyvdc3fqmyux54…, and bc1qva7utdxd6easlj… can be clusterized as belonging to one entity
There's a discrepancy: if the sender wanted to send just 1 bitcoin, there's no need for the first output to be in the transaction, the second would be more than sufficient. That shows that the sender is probably using a non-standard wallet software
The transaction's lock time value is 0 and the sender uses SegWit-copmatible software that generates version 1 transactions. That and (4) can be used to single out the sender's wallet software
Our system gives this transaction the score of 0 as it's too clear which output is the recipient and which is the change.

One important point: it's not probable, but still possible that this partiular transaction's sender tries to confuse forensics software and all the conclusions are incorrect. So, basically, if you're trying to increase your privacy level knowing how to do that, and getting the 0 score, you're probably doing that right.

Let's take another transaction to show some contrast: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/24a517dd2ffbb3a290eeee75d6dea2c62df7ebcd6f898b703b70dc031baa8a18

It has 1 input and 2 outputs:

Input addresses	Input values		Output values	Output addresses
12CBjcNtRU7c795neLC…	0.01006987 BTC	⟾	0.00344481 BTC	199eZE5j4shSU7D9…
0.00640487 BTC	1CGL5micNcJbMaV…
This is a relatively rare example of a transaction getting a 100 score. It's not possible to distinguish the recipient from the change address just by analyzing this transaction.

Heuristics we use:

Heuristic key	Heuristic name	Description and notes	Affects clusterization?	Example transaction	API example
Most common heuristics	♠	♠	♠	♠	♠
inputs	Co-spending	Unless it's a CoinJoin transaction it's safe to assume that all input addresses belong to one person	+	👉	👉
script_types	Script types	If all inputs has the same type, and exactly one of the outputs is not of the same type — this output can be considered as the recipient	+	👉	👉
p2sh_types	P2SH multisig types	If all inputs are m of n multisig P2SH, and all outputs are multisig P2SH, but exactly one of the outputs has another m of n structure — this output can be considered as the recipient	+	👉	👉
p2wsh_types	P2WSH multisig types	If all inputs are m of n multisig P2WSH, and all outputs are multisig P2WSH, but exactly one of the outputs has another m of n structure — this output can be considered as the recipient	+	👉	👉
round_value	Round value	If one of the outputs has a round value (like exactly 1 BTC) — this output can be considered as the recipient	+	👉	👉
recipient_by_value	Recipient by bigger value	If the recipient is the smaller output, there's no point in having some of the inputs	+	👉	👉
t1-2_bigger_value_25	Output value x25	One of the two outputs is 25 times bigger than the other meaning that it's potentially the change output	+	👉	👉
t1-2_bigger_value_100	Output value x100	- 〃 - 〃 - 100 times bigger	+	👉	👉
t1-2_bigger_value_250	Output value x250	- 〃 - 〃 - 250 times bigger	+	👉	👉
t1-2_bigger_value_1000	Output value x1000	- 〃 - 〃 - 1000 times bigger	+	👉	👉
coinbase_known	Known miner	The recipient is the known miner		👉	👉
coinbase_unknown	Unknown miner	The recipient is an unknown miner		👉	👉
coinjoin	Coinjoin	This is a CoinJoin transaction. This cancels all other heuristics.	+	👉	👉
round_fee	Round fee	The transaction has a round fee amount, the sender is probably using some specific software		👉	👉
rare_fingerprint	Rare fingerprint	This transaction has quite unique technical characteristics		👉	👉
Specific order of inputs and outputs	♠	♠	♠	♠	♠
asc_output_values	Ascending output values	For transaction with more than 5 outputs — they are ordered by value ascending — that may due to some specific software usage		👉	👉
desc_output_values	Descending output values	Same, but in descending order. Generally, all descending patterns are more rare than ascending.		👉	👉
asc_output_addresses	Ascending output addresses	Same, but this time it's addresses sorted in alphabetical order		👉	👉
desc_output_addresses	Descending output addresses	- 〃 - 〃 - (Very rare)		👉	👉
asc_input_values	Ascending input values	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, but for inputs		👉	👉
desc_input_values	Descending input values	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
asc_input_addresses	Ascending input addresses	- 〃 - 〃 - (Very rare)		👉	👉
desc_input_addresses	Descending input addresses	- 〃 - 〃 - (Very rare)		👉	👉
asc_input_timestamps	Ascending input timestamps	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, inputs are sorted by age		👉	👉
desc_input_timestamps	Descending input timestamps	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
asc_output_values_except_first	Ascending output values except first	All outputs are sorted by value ascending except for the first one, that may mean that the first output is the change address. But this is a quite vague heuristic, thus we don't use it in clusterization.		👉	👉
asc_output_values_except_last	Ascending output values except last	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
asc_output_addresses_except_first	Ascending output addresses except first	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
asc_output_addresses_except_last	Ascending output addresses except last	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
desc_output_values_except_first	Descending output values except first	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
desc_output_values_except_last	Descending output values except last	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
desc_output_addresses_except_last	Descending output addresses except last	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
desc_output_addresses_except_first	Descending output addresses except first	- 〃 - 〃 -		👉	👉
Reuse of the same address	♠	♠	♠	♠	♠
simple_reuse_1-2	Address reuse	The sender uses the same address for receiving and for change		👉	👉
simple_reuse_N-2	Address reuse	The sender uses the same address for receiving and for change		👉	👉
simple_reuse_1-N	Address reuse	The sender (probably an exchange) uses the same address for receiving and for change		👉	👉
simple_reuse_same_address_in_inputs	Same address in inputs	There's multiple occurences of the same address in inputs		👉	👉
Sweeps	♠	♠	♠	♠	♠
sweep_1-1	Sweep (1-1)	The sender uses the "send everything" option to either pay someone (e.g. an exchange) or just moving the funds to another wallet (1 input)		👉	👉
sweep_1-1_to_another_type	Sweep to another type (1-1)	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, but the outputs is of another type. The sender is either paying someone or moving the funds to a new wallet type (1 input)		👉	👉
sweep_N-1	Sweep	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, but with multiple inputs		👉	👉
sweep_N-1_to_another_type	Sweep to another type	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, but to another address type		👉	👉
Discrepancies	♠	♠	♠	♠	♠
discrepancy_unnecessary_inputs	Discrepancy: unnecessary input	The smaller input is unnecessary, as whichever of the outputs is the recipient, there's no need to include that input		👉	👉
discrepancy_input_types	Discrepancy: various input types	The inputs are of different types. That means the sender is probably using the software allowing to create the same address type for the change as the recipient has, trying to circumvent the script_types heuristic		👉	👉
discrepancy_script_types_and_round_value	Discrepancy between Script types and Round value	script_types and round_value heuristics yield different results	+	👉	👉
discrepancy_script_types_and_recipient_by_value	Discrepancy between Script types and Recipient by value	script_types and recipient by value heuristics yield different results	+	👉	👉
discrepancy_round_value_and_recipient_by_value	Discrepancy between Round value and Recipient by value	round_value and recipient by value heuristics yield different results	+	👉	👉
discrepancy_p2sh_various_input_types	Discrepancy: various P2SH input types	The P2SH input types are different (e.g. one is 2-of-2 multisig, and the other is 2-of-3). Very rare.		👉	👉
discrepancy_p2wsh_various_input_types	Discrepancy: various P2WSH input types	- 〃 - 〃 - Same, but for P2WSH		N/A	N/A
discrepancy_same_address_in_outputs	Discrepancy: output address duplicates	There are outputs with the same address — that makes no economical sense		👉	👉
discrepancy_no_output_of_the_same_type_as_inputs	Discrepancy: no output of the same type as inputs	Probably the sender uses software generating the same change address type as the recipient address has		👉	👉
Possible transaction types are:

Type code	Description
CB	Coinbase transaction
N1	Transaction with just 1 output (either a sweep to another address by the same owner, or a transfer using a "send everything I have" option)
N2	Transaction with 2 outputs — most common in wallets — where one of the outputs is the recipient, and the other one is the change address
NN	Transaction with more than 2 outputs — most common in exchanges and services that use payout batching
Transaction fingerprint:

Property	Possible values	Description
lock_time	0, rare, block_id, big_value, timestamp	Depending on wallet software, lock_time property can either be 0, or a block height, or some timestamp. In rare cases it's some other value (rare or big_value)
version	1, 2, unknown	Versions 1 and 2 are distributed almost equally these days
has_witness	true, false	SegWit usage is a distinctive property — there are wallets and exchanges who are known to be using or not using SegWit
