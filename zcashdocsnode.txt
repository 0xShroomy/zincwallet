encryptwallet - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
encryptwallet "passphrase"

WARNING: encryptwallet is disabled.
To enable it, restart zcashd with the following command line options:
-experimentalfeatures and -developerencryptwallet

Alternatively add these two lines to the zcash.conf file:

experimentalfeatures=1
developerencryptwallet=1

Encrypts the wallet with 'passphrase'. This is for first time encryption.
After this, any calls that interact with private keys such as sending or signing 
will require the passphrase to be set prior the making these calls.
Use the walletpassphrase call for this, and then walletlock call.
If the wallet is already encrypted, use the walletpassphrasechange call.
Note that this will shutdown the server.
Wallet encryption is experimental, and this API should be used with caution.

Arguments:
1. "passphrase"    (string) The pass phrase to encrypt the wallet with. It must be at least 1 character, but should be long.

Examples:

Encrypt you wallet
> zcash-cli encryptwallet "my pass phrase"

Now set the passphrase to use the wallet, such as for signing or sending Zcash
> zcash-cli walletpassphrase "my pass phrase"

Now we can so something like sign
> zcash-cli signmessage "zcashaddress" "test message"

Now lock the wallet again by removing the passphrase
> zcash-cli walletlock 

As a JSON RPC call
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "encryptwallet", "params": ["my pass phrase"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8232/




getbalance - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
getbalance ( "(dummy)" minconf includeWatchonly inZat asOfHeight )

currently includes transparent balances associated with unified
accounts. Prefer to use `z_getbalanceforaccount` instead.

Arguments:
1. (dummy)          (string, optional) Remains for backward compatibility. Must be excluded or set to "*" or "".
2. minconf          (numeric, optional, default=0) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.
3. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false) Also include balance in watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress')
4. inZat            (bool, optional, default=false) Get the result amount in zatoshis (as an integer).
5. asOfHeight       (numeric, optional, default=-1) Execute the query as if it
                    were run when the blockchain was at the height specified by
                    this argument. The default is to use the entire blockchain
                    that the node is aware of. -1 can be used as in other RPC
                    calls to indicate the current height (including the
                    mempool), but this does not support negative values in
                    general. A “future” height will fall back to the current
                    height. Any explicit value will cause the mempool to be
                    ignored, meaning no unconfirmed tx will be considered.
                    `minconf` must be at least 1 when `asOfHeight` is provided.

Result:
amount              (numeric) The total amount in ZEC(or zatoshis if inZat is true) received.

Bitcoin compatibility:
Compatible with up to three arguments.
Examples:

The total amount in the wallet

                    mempool), but this does not support negative values in
                    general. A “future” height will fall back to the current
                    height. Any explicit value will cause the mempool to be
                    ignored, meaning no unconfirmed tx will be considered.

listaddressgroupings - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
listaddressgroupings ( asOfHeight )

Lists groups of transparent addresses which have had their common ownership
made public by common use as inputs or as the resulting change in past transactions.

Arguments:
1. asOfHeight       (numeric, optional, default=-1) Execute the query as if it
                    were run when the blockchain was at the height specified by
                    this argument. The default is to use the entire blockchain
                    that the node is aware of. -1 can be used as in other RPC
                    calls to indicate the current height (including the
                    mempool), but this does not support negative values in
                    general. A “future” height will fall back to the current
                    height. Any explicit value will cause the mempool to be
                    ignored, meaning no unconfirmed tx will be considered.

Result:
[
  [
    [
      "zcashaddress",     (string) The zcash address
      amount,                 (numeric) The amount in ZEC
    ]
    ,...
  ]
  ,...

Bitcoin compatibility:
The zero-argument form is compatible.
Examples:
> zcash-cli listaddressgroupings 
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "listaddressgroupings", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8232/

sendtoaddress - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
sendtoaddress "zcashaddress" amount ( "comment" "comment-to" subtractfeefromamount )

Send an amount to a given transparent address. The amount is interpreted as a real number
and is rounded to the nearest 0.00000001. This API will only select funds from the transparent
pool, and all the details of the transaction, including sender, recipient, and amount will be
permanently visible on the public chain. THIS API PROVIDES NO PRIVACY, and should only be
used when interoperability with legacy Bitcoin infrastructure is required.

Arguments:
1. "zcashaddress"  (string, required) The transparent Zcash address to send to.
2. "amount"      (numeric, required) The amount in ZEC to send. eg 0.1
3. "comment"     (string, optional) A comment used to store what the transaction is for.

                             to which you're sending the transaction. This is not part of the 
                             transaction, just kept in your wallet.
5. subtractfeefromamount  (boolean, optional, default=false) The fee will be deducted from the amount being sent.
                             The recipient will receive less Zcash than you enter in the amount field.

Result:
"transactionid"  (string) The transaction id.

Examples:
> zcash-cli sendtoaddress "t1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd" 0.1
> zcash-cli sendtoaddress "t1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd" 0.1 "donation" "seans outpost"

> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "sendtoaddress", "params": ["t1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd", 0.1, "donation", "seans outpost"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8232/





sendmany - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
sendmany "" {"address":amount,...} ( minconf "comment" ["address",...] )

Send to multiple transparent recipients, using funds from the legacy transparent
value pool. Amounts are decimal numbers with at most 8 digits of precision.
Payments sent using this API are visible on-chain and do not otherwise
provide privacy protections; it should only be used in circumstances 
where it is necessary to interoperate with legacy Bitcoin infrastructure.
Prefer to use `z_sendmany` instead.


Arguments:
1. "dummy"               (string, required) Must be set to "" for backwards compatibility.
2. "amounts"             (string, required) A json object with addresses and amounts
    {
      "address":amount   (numeric) The Zcash address is the key, the numeric amount in ZEC is the value
      ,...
    }
3. minconf                 (numeric, optional, default=1) Only use the balance confirmed at least this many times.
4. "comment"             (string, optional) A comment
5. subtractfeefromamount   (string, optional) A json array with addresses.
                           The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address.
                           Those recipients will receive less Zcash than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                           If no addresses are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
    [
      "address"            (string) Subtract fee from this address
      ,...
    ]

Result:
"transactionid"          (string) The transaction id for the send. Only 1 transaction is created regardless of

walletconfirmbackup - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
walletconfirmbackup "emergency recovery phrase"

CAUTION: This is an internal method that is not intended to be called directly by
users. Please use the zcashd-wallet-tool utility (built or installed in the same directory
as zcashd) instead. In particular, this method should not be used from zcash-cli, in order
to avoid exposing the recovery phrase on the command line.

Notify the wallet that the user has backed up the emergency recovery phrase,
which can be obtained by making a call to z_exportwallet. The zcashd embedded wallet
requires confirmation that the emergency recovery phrase has been backed up before it
will permit new spending keys or addresses to be generated.

Arguments:
1. "emergency recovery phrase" (string, required) The full recovery phrase returned as part
   of the data returned by z_exportwallet. An error will be returned if the value provided
   does not match the wallet's existing emergency recovery phrase.

Examples:
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "walletconfirmbackup", "params": ["abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon art"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8232/




listtransactions - Zcash 6.2.0 RPC
listtransactions ( "dummy" count from includeWatchonly asOfHeight)

Returns up to 'count' of the most recent transactions associated with legacy transparent
addresses of this wallet, skipping the first 'from' transactions.

This API does not provide any information about transactions containing shielded inputs
or outputs, and should only be used in circumstances where it is necessary to interoperate
with legacy Bitcoin infrastructure. Use z_listreceivedbyaddress to obtain information about
the wallet's shielded transactions.

Arguments:
1. (dummy)        (string, optional) If set, should be "*" for backwards compatibility.
2. count          (numeric, optional, default=10) The number of transactions to return
3. from           (numeric, optional, default=0) The number of transactions to skip
4. includeWatchonly (bool, optional, default=false) Include transactions to watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress')
5. asOfHeight       (numeric, optional, default=-1) Execute the query as if it
                    were run when the blockchain was at the height specified by
                    this argument. The default is to use the entire blockchain
                    that the node is aware of. -1 can be used as in other RPC
                    calls to indicate the current height (including the
                    mempool), but this does not support negative values in
                    general. A “future” height will fall back to the current
                    height. Any explicit value will cause the mempool to be
                    ignored, meaning no unconfirmed tx will be considered.
